       2. I have to take this class as a requirement... but I want to learn more about web design because it combines all the subjects (my majors) I'm interested in! I really enjoy typography and would love to be able to create beautiful digital projects like <a href="https://canals-amsterdam.nl/" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html?mtrref=undefined&assetType=REGIWALL&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&assetType=REGIWALL&mtrref=undefined&assetType=REGIWALL" target="_blank">this</a>.

       3. I have taken Intro to Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms, so I know a little bit of Java, but I have no idea how I would apply it to what I want to do. I have started an HTML course on Codecademy/Coursera, but never finished them, so I know some, but very basic HTML.

       4.  I hope to learn CSS and create a website that actually looks like one.

       5.  The majority of designs on screens have a scroll function, or at the very least some type of interaction. Usually for physical designs, you can see everything in entirety, whereas on the computer you can control how much you see and in what order a bit more directly.

        6. I think that <a href="https://simplychocolate.dk/" target="_blank">Simply Chocolate's website</a> uses effective design, which communicates its product and brand clearly. The landing page is fairly loud because of the images, but there is a clear hierarchy through font choice and solid-colored spacers.
        Throughout the entire landing page, the design mimics a chocolate bar. The page is set up so that each "scene" fits on the screen perfectly, which looks like the dimensions of a chocolate bar and emphasizes the idea of the product. There is then a chocolate bar with a unique flavor in the middle of the "scene," creating this bar within a bar type scenario. 
        All of the other pages are very minimal, making it clear to read the story, catalogue, and etc.

        7. <a href="http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/" target="_blank">This portfolio</a> is very minimal and very easy to navigate. Once you get to the landing page, there is a direction that says to "scroll," which immediately directs the viewer. All of the artist's pieces are displayed on one page, making it easy for viewers to navigate and see what they would like to see.

        8. <a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/" target = "_blank">This site</a> has a lot of visual elements and transitions, but works because the viewer can only scroll through the visual path that the designer set for them to traverse. The designer ha d a lot of control over the first-users' experiences. For those who want to skip around the experience aspect of the site, they can click through the top bar.
